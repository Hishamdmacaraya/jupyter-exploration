# **Exploring GitHub and Jupyter Notebooks**

**Objective:** This assignment aimed to familiarize me with GitHub and Jupyter Notebooks, allowing me to set up a version control system and practice interactive computing. I created and managed a GitHub repository, installed and used Jupyter Notebook, and integrated my work into my GitHub repository.

## **Part 1: Setting Up and Exploring GitHub (20 minutes)**

1. Create a GitHub Account (5 minutes):

- I navigated to GitHub and signed up for a new account.

2. Explore the GitHub Interface (5 minutes):

- I explored the GitHub dashboard and learned about repositories, issues, and pull requests.

3. Create a New Repository (5 minutes):
- I clicked on the "+" icon in the top right corner and selected "New repository."
- I named the repository "jupyter-exploration" and initialized it with a README file.

4. Make a First Commit (5 minutes):

- I edited the README file to include a brief description of the lab session and committed the changes to the main branch.

## **Part 2: Jupyter Notebooks (35 minutes)**

1. Installation (10 minutes):

- I followed the instructions in the separate Jupyter Tutorial presentation to install Jupyter Notebook.

2. Launching Jupyter Notebook (5 minutes):

- I launched Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab and familiarized myself with the interface, including the notebook dashboard, file list, and kernels.

3. Create Your First Notebook (5 minutes):

- I opened Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab, created a new notebook, and added a Markdown cell with text such as "My first markdown cell in Jupyter."
- I then added a new cell, changed it to Code, wrote Python code (e.g., print("Hello, World!")), and ran the code cell using Shift + Enter.

4 Saving and Sharing through GitHub (5 minutes):

- I saved my notebook and uploaded it to the "jupyter-exploration" GitHub repository I had created earlier.
